## Due Wednesday, October 12

### Further Reading

Please read through the Viking Code School article, [Git For Ages 4 And Up (Youtube)](https://youtu.be/1ffBJ4sVUb4). This is a really wonderful video that explains how git works in very basic and illustrative terms.

### Exercise 1

- Create a tar file containing the `bacon.txt` file from the in-class exercises
  - The destination of this file should be `~/terminal-exercises` directory
  - If you no longer have a local copy of the `bacon.txt` file, a copy of it has been pinned in the Slack channel

### Exercise 2

- Write your own shell script!
  - It should:
    - Create a directory in `~/terminal-exercises/`
    - Create a file in that directory with 3 lines of content
    - Create a second file in that directory with 2 lines of content
    - Create a file with the combined contents of both of the above files
    - Compress that file
    - Move that tar to `terminal-exercises` directory
    - Rename the file to be `my-first-shell-script.tar`
    - Delete the directory created in step 1
    - Each action of the script should be printed in the terminal window as it progresses
